<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module will allow users to subscribe to email alerts when comments are posted on stories they follow. Users can subscribe or unsubscribe to comment alerts with a single click, or they can automatically subscribe too all of the stories that they have submitted.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Upload the module files to your Pligg directory. The comment_subscription directory should be located within the /modules directory.</li>
	<li>Log into an admin account and visit the Admin > Modules > Uninstalled Modules, then click on the install button.</li>
	<li>Click on the settings button from the Admin > Modules > Uninstalled Modules > Comment Subscription listing. You will also find a link to this module's settings page from the Admin Dashboard titled "Comment Subscription Module".</li>
	<li>Edit the fields on this page to suit your needs, then press the Submit button to save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>After installing the module, you may want to edit the template that is being used to generate emails. To do this, you will want to modify the /modules/comment_subscription/templates/email.tpl file. At the top of the file you will find a configuration area where you can change some basic settings without having to dig much further into the template file. Please remember to test the module prior to making any changes to this file so that you can determine if your own changes cause the module to break.</p>
<p>To subscribe to all future stories, users need to visit the "edit profile" page (where you update your name, email, etc) and select the checkbox for "Automatically Subscribe to Comment Notifications for My Stories". Please note that subscribing to all of your stories will only subscribe to stories submitted after saving that setting. It will not retroactively subscribe to all of your previously published stories.</p>
