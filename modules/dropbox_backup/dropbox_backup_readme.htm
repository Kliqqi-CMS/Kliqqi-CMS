<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module generates backup files, which are then sent to your Dropbox account for safe keeping. All that you have to do is generate the files that you want backed up using the <a href="admin_backup.php">Admin File &amp; MySQL Backup tool</a>, then fill in your Dropbox credentials and then "Perform Backup". It will zip up all of the files from the /admin/backup/ directory and post them to your Dropbox account.</p>
<p>If you would like, you can customize what folder the files are placed in using the "Dropbox Directory" field. Begin this field with a forward slash when entering a subdirectory name, or remove the whole contents to place the backup file into the base of your Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>Please note that the password field stores the Dropbox password as plain text in the MySQL database, so I recommend that you remove the contents of that field after you complete the Dropbox transfer. There are some left over bits that I commented out in the PHP file while I was considering making a setting so that you could disable saving the Dropbox password altogether. To save time I ended up abandoning that effort.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Make sure that both the /admin/backup/ and /modules/dropbox_backup/backup/ directories are set to CHMOD 777.</p>
<p>You will need to save the module settings before being able to press the "Perform Backup" button.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Check your /cache/log.php file for hints if something is going wrong. If you want to report an issue to the forums, we may ask you to provide the contents of that file.</p>
<p>Some servers may return an error similar to "Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Cannot execute request: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:" in their error logs. You may be able to find a solution for this after <a href="http://unitstep.net/blog/2009/05/05/using-curl-in-php-to-access-https-ssltls-protected-sites/">reading this article</a>.</p>
<p>If you try to "Perform Backup" and it returns a blank page, check the /cache/log.php file for the most recent entry. If it shows something like: "PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Login unsuccessful.'", then your email/password combination is probably not correct. We hope to improve this error handling down the road if we find time.</p>
<p>Because this makes use of a third party service, and because it is a free module, I will not be providing ongoing support for this module.</p>
